# Brief History of Artificial Intelligence

1. Turing Machine
2. Turing Test - Can Machine Think

1956 - Dartmouth Conference - AI is born

from 1990s onwards there was a move from rule based to statistical approach

Key Event: IBM Deep Blue defeats Kasparov
Growth of data and Computational power

Models: Decision Trees, SVMS, Ensemble Learning


In 2012 - Came AlexNet wins ImageNet - Breakthrough

GPU Power + Big Data = neural network rebirth

Key Milestore: AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol (2016)

AI powers speech, vision and self driving tech

In 2017 came Transformers: Key Architectural Shift

Main Paper: Attention is all you need


# Challenges and Considerations with AI
1. Bias and fairness
2. Explainability and hallucinations
3. Alignment and Control
4. Regulatory and ethical debates
