## 🧠 Local LLMs (Large Language Models)

### 📌 What Are Local LLMs?

Local LLMs are language models that run on your **own hardware**, without needing access to cloud APIs. You can run them on:

* Laptops/Desktops (with CPU or GPU)
* Edge devices (like Raspberry Pi)
* Local servers or clusters

* **Safetensors**: Used for secure and fast inference, especially with HuggingFace libraries
* **PyTorch/Transformers Checkpoints**: Full precision model weights (.bin/.pth) for GPUs

### 🧮 Quantization

#### ❓ What is Quantization?

Reducing the **bit-width** (precision) of model weights to shrink size and speed up inference.

#### 🧰 Types of Quantization:

| Type                      | Precision | Size       | Speed     | Quality Loss |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| **FP32**                  | 32-bit    | Huge       | Slow      | None         |
| **FP16**                  | 16-bit    | Medium     | Faster    | Low          |
| **INT8**                  | 8-bit     | Small      | Fast      | Some         |
| **Q4\_0 / Q5\_K / Q8\_0** | Custom    | Very Small | Very Fast | Varies       |

📝 **Trade-off**: Lower quantization = smaller, faster models but slightly lower accuracy.

#### ✅ Why Use It?

* Run on CPU-only devices
* Fit large models in small VRAM (e.g., 7B model on 4GB RAM)

## 💾 Memory Requirements for Running Local LLMs

### 📌 Key Memory Types to Consider

| Memory Type             | Used For                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **VRAM (GPU RAM)**      | Storing and running model weights on the GPU        |
| **RAM (System Memory)** | Holding model weights and buffers on CPU            |
| **Disk (Storage)**      | Storing model files (GGUF, .bin, safetensors, etc.) |

---

### 📊 Approximate VRAM / RAM Requirements (for CPU or GPU inference)

| Model Size | Full Precision (FP16/32) | Quantized (Q4, Q5) | Notes                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **1–2B**   | 2–4 GB                   | 1–2 GB             | Suitable for mobile/edge                     |
| **3–7B**   | 8–16 GB                  | 3–6 GB             | Usable on high-RAM laptops or mid-range GPUs |
| **13B**    | 20–28 GB                 | 8–12 GB            | Needs strong desktop with GPU or lots of RAM |
| **33B+**   | 40–80 GB+                | 16–32 GB+          | Requires powerful GPU or multiple GPUs       |

📝 **Rule of Thumb**:

* For quantized models (like Q4\_0), you usually need **\~1GB per 1B parameter**.
* Add **extra 2–4GB** for buffers, context, and runtime overhead.

---

### 📦 Disk Space Requirements

| Model Type            | Typical Size (Uncompressed) |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **7B (GGUF, Q4\_0)**  | \~3–5 GB                    |
| **13B (GGUF, Q5\_K)** | \~8–10 GB                   |
| **70B (GGUF, Q6\_K)** | \~30–40 GB                  |

📁 Ensure your disk is **SSD**, not HDD, for faster loading and paging.

---

### ⚠️ Key Considerations

* **Context Length**: Longer contexts (e.g., 8K, 16K tokens) use more memory.
* **Streaming vs Full Generation**: Streaming uses less memory at once.
* **Batch Size**: Running multiple prompts in parallel increases usage.
* **Tool Overhead**: UI-based tools (LM Studio, TextGen WebUI) add to baseline memory use.

---

### 🧠 Optimization Tips

* Use **quantized models** (e.g., Q4\_K\_M, Q5\_K\_M) for smaller VRAM/RAM needs.
* On **CPU-only machines**, use `llama.cpp` with lower quantization (Q4 or Q3).
* For **low-end GPUs**, pick models under 7B and use `--low-vram` modes where supported.
* Use **Ollama** for automatic memory-adaptive quantized model loading.

## 👥 Multithreading & Concurrency in Local LLMs (Multi-User Context)

### 🔁 1. Single-threaded Inference per Request (Common)

Most local LLM backends (like `llama.cpp` or `Ollama`) handle **one generation at a time**, even if the backend itself is multithreaded.

* Each inference request (i.e., a single user prompt) uses **multiple CPU threads**.
* If a second user sends a request while one is already generating, it may:

  * Get queued (if there's a request queue)
  * Get rejected (depending on server logic)
  * Slow down both requests (if you run multiple instances manually)

➡️ **Local LLMs are not inherently concurrent** like a web server—they usually don't do true parallel inference.

---

### 🧱 2. Running Concurrent Inference: Scaling Challenges

#### ✅ Approaches:

* **Parallel processes**: Run multiple model instances (e.g., with separate ports) and load-balance.
* **Request queue + worker pool**: Serialize access with threads per user, reusing model context.
* **Web UI / server-layer isolation**: Use a server (e.g., FastAPI, Express.js, or LM Studio’s backend) to queue and dispatch user prompts.

#### ⚠️ Bottlenecks:

| Resource          | Limiting Factor                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU threads**   | Each inference may consume 4–8+ threads                          |
| **RAM**           | Each model copy needs several GB (e.g., 7B model = \~6GB for Q4) |
| **VRAM** (if GPU) | Not shared well between processes (unless using batching)        |

---

### 🧠 What Actually Happens on Multithreaded Multi-User Load?

* Multiple users = **increased contention** for threads and memory.
* If using 8 threads for one user, and another user requests a response:

  * Either request must wait, or you reduce thread usage per session.
* Running **multiple models in parallel** (e.g., 2 x 7B models) requires double the RAM and CPU.

---

### 📌 Strategies for Supporting Multiple Users

| Method                 | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Thread Pool Tuning** | Limit per-inference thread count (e.g., 4 instead of 8) to allow more sessions |
| **Load Balancing**     | Spin up multiple backend processes and route traffic to them                   |
| **Session Queueing**   | Accept requests and queue them per user session (like a chatbot queue)         |
| **Lightweight Models** | Use smaller, quantized models to reduce memory & thread usage                  |
| **Model Caching**      | Reuse attention cache to speed up responses for ongoing sessions               |

---

### 🧪 Example (with Ollama HTTP API)

Ollama does **not support concurrent generations** by default:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama3", "prompt": "Hi"}'
# While this is running, a second request will wait or error
```

You can:

* Use a FastAPI server to queue prompts
* Launch multiple Ollama instances on different ports (with different models or duplicated models)
* Limit thread usage via `.ollama/config`:

```toml
[defaults]
num-parallel = 1
num-threads = 4
```

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
