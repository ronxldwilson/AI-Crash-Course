# Neural Network 

Neural networks are a subset of machine learning models inspired by the way biological neural networks (like the brain) process information. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes (or "neurons"), each of which performs a simple mathematical operation. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Neurons**: These are the individual units in a neural network. Each neuron takes one or more inputs, applies a weight to them, sums them up, and then passes the result through a function (often called an activation function).

2. **Layers**: Neural networks are typically organized in layers:
   - **Input Layer**: This layer receives the input data (e.g., an image, text, or other data types).
   - **Hidden Layers**: These intermediate layers process the input through neurons, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.
   - **Output Layer**: The final layer produces the result (e.g., a classification, prediction, etc.).

3. **Weights and Biases**: Each connection between neurons has a weight that adjusts the signal strength, and each neuron has a bias that shifts the output. These weights and biases are learned and optimized during the training process.

4. **Activation Function**: After the weighted sum is calculated, an activation function (such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh) determines if the neuron should be activated and which signal should be passed to the next layer.

5. **Training Process**: Neural networks are trained using a method called **backpropagation**, where the network makes predictions, compares them with actual values, and adjusts its weights and biases to minimize error using optimization algorithms like **gradient descent**.

Neural networks are used for a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding, and even in generating creative content like art and music.
