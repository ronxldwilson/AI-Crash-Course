# Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model

## 🧠 What is this paper about?

- Language models (LMs) often need to be **aligned with human preferences**.
- The standard way to do this is **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
- RLHF has many parts: train a reward model → do reinforcement learning (like PPO).
- This paper proposes a **simpler and more stable method** called **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**.

---

## ❗ Problem with RLHF

- Needs a separate **reward model**.
- Uses **complex reinforcement learning** (e.g., PPO).
- **Unstable** and **slow** to train.
- Needs a lot of **tuning and compute**.

---

## ✅ What is DPO?

- A **new method** to align language models **without using reinforcement learning**.
- Trains the model **directly on preference data** using standard cross-entropy loss.
- Based on math that shows we can **skip reward modeling entirely**!

## 🧪 How does DPO work?

1. You collect **human preference data**: pairs of outputs (one preferred, one not).
2. For each prompt `x`, and responses:
   - `y_w` = preferred response
   - `y_l` = less preferred response
3. You update the model using the DPO **loss function**, which encourages the model to:
   - Increase the probability of `y_w`
   - Decrease the probability of `y_l`
   - Stay close to the original model (called the reference model)

---

## 🧮 DPO Loss (Simplified)

```math
log(σ(β * [log π_θ(y_w | x) - log π_θ(y_l | x) - log π_ref(y_w | x) + log π_ref(y_l | x)]))
````

* σ = sigmoid function
* π\_θ = current model
* π\_ref = reference model (before fine-tuning)
* β = temperature parameter (controls sharpness)

---

## ⚙️ Why is DPO better?

* ✅ **No reward model** needed
* ✅ **No reinforcement learning** (like PPO)
* ✅ **Faster and simpler**
* ✅ **More stable** training
* ✅ Works well with **standard supervised learning setups**

---

## 📊 How well does it work?

* Tested on tasks like:

  * **Sentiment control**
  * **Summarization**
  * **Dialogue**
* DPO matched or beat PPO-based RLHF methods.
* Used in popular open-source models like:

  * **Zephyr-7B**
  * **TÜLU 2 70B**

---

## 💡 Big Idea

> "Your language model is secretly a reward model."

* This means: LMs can be **trained directly from preferences**, without extra machinery.
* DPO shows that **simple, preference-based training** can achieve what RLHF does — more easily.
