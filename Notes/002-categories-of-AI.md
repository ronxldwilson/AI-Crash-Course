# Types and categories of AI models and Techniques

## What is Artificial Intelligence


## Why Categorize AI Models

### High Level categoriezation
- Symbolic AI: Rule Based Reasoning, expert systems
- Machine Learning: Pattern based Learning from data
- Deep Learning: Neural networks and representation Learning

### Neural Networks
- Structure: Input, Hidden layers, Output Layers - it is generally a Feed forward
- Activation Function: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh 
- Use Case: Basic classification and regression
- In Training we then use weights and biases to do back prpogation 

### Convolutional Neural Networks 
- Designed for spatial data(images, videos)
- Layers: Convolution, pooling, fully connected
- Use Cases: Object detection, image classification

### Recurrent Neural Networks
- Sequential data processing
- Internal state/memory inputs
- Limitation: vanishing gradient problems 

### LSTM - Long Short Term Memory 
### GRUs - Gated Recurrent Units

### NLP - Natural Languae Processing
- Text tokenization, POS tagging
- Word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe
- Traditional Vs NLP models

### Transformers
- Attention Mechanism: Self Attention, Multi Head
- Architecture: Encoder-decoder(e.g. GPT, BERT)
- Applications: Translation, summarization, chatbots
- Every Token is analysed with other tokens
- That led to the Encoder decoder Models

### Reinforement Learning
- Pre-training is done first, a lot of data is taken and the model is trained on the basics
- In RL - the interactions between the Agent, environment interaction.
- Core Concept: reward, state, action, policy
- Use Cases: AlphaGo, robotics, gameAI

### Mixture of Experts
- Using specific models for each of the task

## Real World relevance and applications
1. Foundation Models (e.g.GPT, Claude)
2. Multimodal AI (language + vision + audio)
3. Explainability, ethics and responsible AI
